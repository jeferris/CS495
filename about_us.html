        <p id="about">
            I am a Computer Science major with a minor in Art (Digital Media). I am from the great city of 
            Talladega, Alabama where "If you aren't first, you're last." My hobbies consist of video gaming,
            producing music, playing with my dog (Ice), and learning card tricks. A fun fact about me is I
            got married at the young age of 23. Another fun fact about myself is that I am a voice actor in an
            extremely popular youtube cartoon series (Disclaimer: R-Rated).

            I am a Senior majoring in Computer Science, born and raised in Saint Louis, Missouri. Some of
            my hobbies include sports, spending time with family and friends, and playing and developing 
            video games. Two fun facts about me are that I write my checkmarks backwards, and I am a state
            champion comedian!

            I am a Computer Science major with a minor in Math and I grew up in 
            Jasper, Alabama. I love anything related to astronomy and I am 
            on a design team that is working on an object recognition and tracking 
            project. A fun fact is that I have a watch that displays the time in 
            binary code. Another fun fact is that I am a classically trained pianist.

    <h2>Project Information</h2>
    <div class="page" style="text-align: center; margin: 0px; ">
        <h3>Project Goals:</h3>
        <p>Create a way for ride share drivers to interact with one another similar to Facebook</p>
        <p>Allow drivers to see what events are going on in the area</p>
        <p>Provide a way for drivers to record their expenses, such as gas and maintenance</p>
        <h3>See our presentations below:</h3>
        <p>During this project, we followed the scrum method of software development and 
            had 3 sprints where we worked on different elements of our application.</p>
        <p>You will see that our project developed more as we went from one sprint to the next.</p>

                Sprint 2</a>

            Sprint 3
        </p>
        <h3>Mock-Ups:</h3>
        <p>Login/Sign Up</p>
        <p>On this page, users are able to create an account and then log into that account.</p>
        <img src="images/LoginMock.png">
        <p>User Screens</p>
        <p>On the home screen, this is where drivers are able to post statuses similar to applications like Facebook</p>
        <p>On the events page, this is where drivers would be able to see which events are happening in the areas 
            so they know where to go to pick up the maximum number of riders</p>
        <p>On the hotspots page, this is where drivers would be able to see where popular areas are</p>
        <p>On the business page, this is where drivers can log their expenses and track how much they have spent on expenses</p>
        <img src="images/AppMock.png">
        <p>Messaging</p>
        <p>This feature would allow drivers to communicate with one another and tell them what areas to avoid and what areas
            to go to. </p>
        <p>Drivers could also welcome new drivers to the area and give advice.</p>
